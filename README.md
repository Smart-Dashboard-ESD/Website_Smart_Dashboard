- `dev` is the development branch of the repository and contains the latest development version of the code.
- `feature/feature_name` branches are used to develop new features and are merged into `dev` when they are ready.
- commits formatted as `feat/feature_name` are used to fix bugs in the code and are merged into `dev` when they are ready.
